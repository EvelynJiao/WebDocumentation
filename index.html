			<h2>Reflection on Proposal</h2>
			<p>After a series of testing and usage by multiple users, there are a few feedbacks that allows me to further improve my prototype from the proposal mockups.
</p>

<p>
  First of all, there is a clear confusion between the headings I have used in my mockups. The difference is not prominent to differentiate between titles and descriptions. Changes has been made in the prototype to make things clearer. Moreover, the mockup solely works on the web and is not mobile-friendly. It is not responsive enough to look decent in the mobile experience.
  </p>

  <p>Furthermore, there are lack of consideration in the user experience for form control and buttons in the mockup. The forms are too vague which might cause user to fill in wrongly. Some inconsistency in the buttons design also doesnt comply to the consistency of the website.
  </p>
</section>
		
	<section id="principle">
			<h2>Design Principle</h2>
        <p>In this section, there will showcase multiple design principles that I have implemented in the course of this prototype.
        </p>

			<h3 id="purposes">1. Website Purposes</h3>
      <p>Starlight Children's Foundation is considered as a non-profit website that are not assigned to the tasks of increasing the profits of a company or organization despite having the donation button.</p>

      <p>The purpose of a website must be recognized when the user reach the landing page. There are severals key visual in the prototype that easily convey the purpose of the website to the user.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The logo with the foundation's name.</li>
        <li>The stand out "Donate" button in the top right corner.</li>
        <li>The screen width image with the text "Brightening the lives of sick kids".</li>
      </ul>


        <figure class="img-container">

        <!-- insert a picture -->
			<br>
			<h3 id="simplicity">2. Simplicity</h3>
      <p>
        Simplicity is the best way to go when considering the user experience and usability of a website. The concept of simplicity is shown from the prototype through multiple aspects.
      </p>

      <p>
        First of all, the overall color of the prototype is purple and yellow which align with the color of the logo. From the studies of Alice Walker in The Color Purple Symbolism, Imagery, Allegory, the color purple represents all the good things in the world God creates for men and women to enjoy. For the color yellow, it symbolize happiness, positivity and optimism. These 2 colors go well with the cause of the foundation as well as the website. 
      </p>

         <figcaption><center><b>Mood board used in the proposal</b><center></figcaption>
          <img src="images/mood-board-1.jpg" width="100%">
        </figure>	

        <p>
        Typography is important to command attention and works as visual interpretation. A bigger font with a bold is often used for a title while a smaller font is used for its description. We can see the efficient use of font sizes in the visual below.  
      </p>

          <img src="images/simplicity-content-2.PNG" width="100%">
        </figure>	

        <p>Color contrast is used in button options in the Donation page while the color consistency of buttons throughtout the whole prototype is remained the same.</p>

        </figure>	
      <br>
      <h3 id="navigation">3. Navigation</h3>

      <p>
        Navigation is the way users interact and find what they are looking for from the website. Each navigation button should show precisely their function which is clear to the user. 
      </p>

      <p>
        Not only that we need a way for the user to navigate. After navigation, the navigation tab also have to clearly show where currently the user is at the moment. Therefore, it is important to add css effect on various state of a button like hover, focussed and active. 
      </p>

      <figure class="img-container">
         <figcaption><center><b>Navigation for web</b><center></figcaption>
         <br>
          <img src="images/prototype-header.PNG" width="100%">
          <br>
      <figcaption><center><b>Navigation for mobile</b><center></figcaption>
      <br>
          <img src="images/prototype-header-mobile.PNG" width="100%">
        </figure>

      <br>

      <h3 id="pattern">4. F-Shaped Pattern Reading</h3>
      <p>The F-based pattern is the most common way user scan text on a website. In an eyetracking study by NN group, users tend to first read in a horizontal movement, usually across the upper part og the content area. Simply said - left to right, top to bottom. However in a more recent 2017 follow up studies by them, F-shaped Pattern of reading on the web is no longer the way most users perceive information</p>

      <figure class="img-container">

          <img src="images/pattern-eyetracking.PNG" width="100%">
        </figure>

      <p></P>

      <h3 id="content">5. Content</h3>
      <p>An effective web design must use compelling language and great content to attract and influence their users. Information in the prototype has been made straightforward and easy to understand from the user's point of view. Content  have also been proof read by multiple users to make sure there is no typo nor grammatical error for the prototype to remain professional. Informational error tend to make users have trust issue in the genuinity of the content</p>

      <h3 id="responsive">6. Mobile Friendly</h3>
      <p>The prototype have been made to be responsive in order for user to view in other devices. Screenshot of usage in smaller devices are shown in <a href="#mobile">Mobile Prototype</a>.</p>
